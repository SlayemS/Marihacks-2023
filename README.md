Parktivity - A website for Montrealers

by Sayem Shah, Hayk Petrosyan, Maxym Galenko and Hussain Amin


Problem:

Have you ever went to a parc and weren't allowed to do a cookout with your friends? There are many parks all over Montreal that don't allow you to partake in particular activities and there is no way to know in advance whether you can or not. For instance, park X allows people to do walk their dogs, but park Y does not. Furthermore, this information is not publicly available.


Solution:

The goal of our web application is to let people inform themselves of what activities a parc permits so they can choose the right parc for the activity they want to do without getting told off. In addition, they can chat with others to let them know what they're up to in order to organize events.
